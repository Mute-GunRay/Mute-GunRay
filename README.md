## Who am I?

Hi there, My name is Tate and I am a Freelance Software Engineer and amateur game developer. I learned software engineering by attending Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp. There I learned full stack web development using React for the front end and Ruby on Rails for the back end. Since graduating I have been working doing freelance work to build up professional credentials. In my off time I work on my various passion projects, these include my four blogs, and a handful of games. 

## Why Software Engineering?
I have been fascinated by computers and computer software of all kinds for most of my life. Although I had wanted to persue a career in technology from a young age life had different plans for me. Then the covid pandemic hit. I used this time to rekindle my passion for Software Engineering and made the decision to make a career transition. This led me to enroll in Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp where I raised my knowledge and skills to a professional level. 

## What is my skill set?
I am proficient to varying degrees in multiple areas of software engineering both in web development as well as small scale desktop programs.

## Who am I?

Hi there. My name is Tate and I am a freelance software engineer and amature game developer. I learned software engineering by attending Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp. There I learned full stack web development using React for the front end and Ruby on Rails for the back end. Since graduating I have been working doing freelance work to build up professional credentials. In my off time I work on my various passion projects, these include my four blogs, and a handful of games.
